Welcome to the main Recupero Robotics Github repository.

Recupero Robotics LLC is a pioneering Rehabilitation Robotics company founded by a group of like-minded innovators whose mission is to create affordable and accessible rehabilitation and assistive technologies that supports the functional independence of adults and children with disabilities across their lifespan.

There are several technical challenges to develop Rehabilitation, Amplification, and Assistive (haptic) high-functioning powered hand orthoses and exoskeletons.  

Recupero is developing a suite of wearable devices to improve capacity to manipulate objects and perform tasks towards increasing independent living. To support activities of daily living and therapy, we are currently developing powered hand orthoses and haptic consoles that integrate novel mechanisms and seamlessly interconnected sensing and software. Our goal is to make accessible devices that effectively empower and enable individuals. 

In 2024, the unique design performance specifications that we are working towards will allow users and therapists to comfortably expand function, Range of Motion exercises and tracking in comparison to the present standard-of-care. Recupero engineers and scientists have been working with Clinicians, younger and older adults to interface reconfigurable low profile wearable hand robots with smart games. Our devices are being devised to enable single and multi-digit movement and strengthening, as well as pinch, power and hook grips. 

The R1 robot is currently undergoing clinical trials.
